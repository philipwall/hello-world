# hello-world
This is my first GitHub repository.

I enjoy the logic of programming, and I can already see how GitHub helps keep your coding progress 
organized.  I am excitied to move forward with learning how to best utilize GitHub.

One thing I must decided on is, which programming language to pursue.  This decision seems to have 
become more difficult with the number of programming languages available today as compared to 30 years ago, and where and how they are used.

More later.
